# Business Metrics & Performance Analysis

## Investment Strategy Performance

### Contrarian Value Strategy Implementation

The system implements a systematic contrarian value investment approach based on quantitative analysis of market drawdowns and mean reversion principles.

#### Strategy Logic
- **Entry Criteria**: Identify stocks with significant drawdowns from recent peaks (typically >20%)
- **Ranking System**: Systematic ranking based on 180-day peak-to-current price decline
- **Portfolio Management**: Equal-weight positions across top-ranked opportunities
- **Exit Strategy**: Profit-taking when portfolio average return exceeds 100%
