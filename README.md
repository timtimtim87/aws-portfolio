# AWS Cloud Solutions Portfolio

## About Me
AWS-focused cloud engineer with hands-on experience building production-grade serverless applications. I specialize in cost-effective, scalable architectures that deliver measurable business value.

## Featured Project: AWS Serverless Stock Screener

A production serverless application demonstrating end-to-end AWS development skills through automated stock market analysis. The system processes 200+ stocks daily using Lambda, delivers insights via Telegram bot, and operates for under $5/month—showcasing both technical excellence and cost-conscious engineering.

**Key Technical Highlights:**
- **Cost Optimization**: 90% cost reduction through smart architecture choices (CSV storage vs. traditional databases)
- **Serverless Architecture**: Event-driven design with Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudWatch
- **Security Best Practices**: Parameter Store encryption, least-privilege IAM, zero hardcoded secrets
- **Production Monitoring**: Custom CloudWatch metrics, structured logging, comprehensive error handling
